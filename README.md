Fighter game written in Turbo Pascal for Windows as an assignment for a high
school "Computer Math" class. This project was sort of a milestone for me, as
my first foray into object-oriented and GUI programming. A good portion of the
month I spent developing it went into puzzling over concepts like encapsulation
and inheritance, and reading and re-reading the Turbo Pascal programmers'
guides to figure out how to make things happen with its windowing library. At
the end of that period came a frantic programming effort to get menus and high
scores screens working, implement game saving and loading, and tweak the
gameplay and graphical intro screen into perfection before the assignment was
due. It was pretty fun.
